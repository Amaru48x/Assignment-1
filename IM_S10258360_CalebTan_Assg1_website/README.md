The McDonald's Singapore Website Revamp
The revamp is to simplify the contents of the website by making all available content into a clickable slider.

Design Process
Background is white and elements are light brownish color to enable visitors of the website to be able to read clearly.

As a user type, I want to be able to find what I want in the website easily, so that I can see the available items on the menu quickly and order food efficiently.

Features
Clickable buttons at the top to navigate to different pages quickly for example Menu, About Us and Locate Us

Existing Features
Menu
McDelivery
About Us
Locate Us
Many panels of clickable content which is too long.

Features Left to Implement
Link to social media and promotional events
